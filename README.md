Chrome Extension to switch between dota 2 stat websites easily

To Demo This Locally:

2. In chrome browser, go to: chrome://extensions/
3. Toggle "Developer Mode" to ON
4. Click "Load Unpacked"
5. Select root folder of the repo you just cloned (should be the "dota_stat_switch" directory -- has manifest.json in it)
